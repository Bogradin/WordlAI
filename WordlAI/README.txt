WordlAI is an artificial intelligence capable of playing the browser game Wordle.

Game Description:

A random 5-letter word is selected from a database.
The player has 6 attempts to guess the secret word.
After each attempt, the player receives feedback about their inputted word.
A green square in the feedback indicates that a letter is in the correct position.
A yellow square indicates that a letter is correct but in the wrong position.
A red square indicates that the secret word does not contain the inputted letter.
Code Usage:

The user is prompted to enter a 'sample,' which represents the number of matches the AI will play.
During the AI's gameplay, all inputs and feedback are printed.
At the end, a summary is presented, including the number of games won, time elapsed, and a CSV file containing all the data.
